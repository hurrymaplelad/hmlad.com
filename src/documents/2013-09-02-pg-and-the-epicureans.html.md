> Don't fear god, <br/>
Don't worry about death; <br/>
What is good is easy to get, and <br/>
What is terrible is easy to endure

> Don't ignore your dreams; <br/>
Don't work too much; <br/>
Say what you think; <br/>
Cultivate friendships; <br/>
Be happy

Stoicism is making a bit of a comeback in tech circles.  Folks find
<!-- more -->
[stability][startup] through the startup emotional rollercoaster and stop [spending money][money] on things they don't need so they can [live their dreams][dreams].  Recommendations for *The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius* [are][rec1] [everywhere][rec2].

PG's [post][pgtodo], inspired by a nurse who spent a lot of time with dying people, nailed a lingering doubt I had about tech's stoic obsession.  A city full of stoics would not be much fun.

San Francisco has taken a beating lately, and socially graceless, self-priotizing people are a [common criticism][graces].  Could stoicism worsen the problem by giving us philosophical justification for building up emotional walls, for focusing things within our control and neglecting our would-be friends?

Epicureanism, a rival school of Hellenistic Greek philosophy, has a different focus.  Something like:  friends are important;  treasure your relationships.  Money is [well spent](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114031/money-happiness-and-new-science-smarter-spending) on experiences that help them grow.  I like that focus.
