Suppose you read [this book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590308492/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1590308492&linkCode=as2&tag=hurr0c-20&linkId=PEFEB4SBKUWRWCSQ) only once.  It might be very good reading.  But what would happen you if read it twice, three times, four times, or more?  In the beginner's mind there is no thought, "I have attained something."
